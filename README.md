# Workspace_for_coding
The aim of this project is to create a practical workspace. This workspace can detect the various Visual Studio releases from 2019 onwards. It will detect the presence of Cmake and Git software for project building and version management. There will also be examples of working structures for the creation of a game engine and for a classic project. The project will also use Watchdog, a Python library, to place .h and .cpp files in the right folders. It will also use Conan for various libraries.
